### ## High-Level Overview

The script is a self-contained scientific tool designed to test a new theory of cosmology, the **Quantum Spacetime Fluid (QSTF)** model, against real-world astronomical data. Its ultimate goal is to see if this new model can solve the **Hubble Tension** by comparing its "goodness-of-fit" to the data against that of the standard **Lambda-CDM ($\Lambda$CDM)** model.

The script operates in three main phases:
1.  **Fits the QSTF model** to a comprehensive set of data to find its best-fit parameters.
2.  **Calculates the goodness-of-fit** for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model using the same data.
3.  **Compares the two models** and calculates the statistical significance of the result.

### ## Section-by-Section Breakdown

The code is organized into five logical sections.

#### **1. The QSTF Cosmological Model**
This section defines the new theory. The `QSTF_Cosmology_Model` class translates the physics of the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) into Python code.
* `analytical_quantum_field()`: This is the core of the theory, defining a mathematical formula (an ansatz) for the behavior of the quantum fluid's wavefunction ($\Psi$) over cosmic time.
* `w_quantum_field()`: This function calculates the dark energy **equation of state `w(z)`** from the wavefunction. This is the most important physical property, as its dynamic, epoch-dependent nature is what allows the model to solve the Hubble Tension.
* `H_z()`: This function implements the **modified Friedmann equation**, calculating the universe's expansion rate using the unique dark energy from the QSTF model.
* `angular_diameter_distance()`, `sound_horizon()`, etc.: These are standard cosmological functions that calculate the necessary quantities (distances, etc.) based on the model's unique expansion history.

#### **2. Observational Datasets**
This section loads all the real-world data into a simple container class. It includes the summary statistics from four key surveys:
* **DESI DR2**: Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements.
* **SH0ES & TRGB**: Two independent, direct measurements of the local Hubble constant, $H_0$.
* **Planck 2018**: Geometric information from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

#### **3. Statistical Analysis Framework**
This section contains the statistical engine that connects the theory to the data.
* `chi2_...()` functions: There is a separate function to calculate the **chi-squared ($\chi^2$)** for each dataset. This value quantifies how well a given set of model parameters matches the observational data.
* `chi2_combined_qstf()`: This is the **objective function**. It sums up the chi-squared values from all datasets into a single number. The goal of the optimizer is to make this number as small as possible.
* `fit_qstf_model()`: This function uses `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` to find the **best-fit parameters** for the QSTF model. It's an evolutionary algorithm that intelligently searches through the 13-dimensional parameter space to find the combination that results in the minimum total chi-squared.

#### **4. LambdaCDM Model for Comparison**
This section defines a simplified version of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. It contains its own functions for calculating cosmic distances based on its simpler, non-evolving dark energy. This allows for a direct, apples-to-apples comparison with the QSTF model.

#### **5. Main Execution**
This is the main block that runs the entire analysis from top to bottom.
1.  It initializes the data and the analyzer.
2.  It calls `fit_qstf_model()` to perform the computationally intensive search for the best-fit QSTF model.
3.  It prints the best-fit parameters and a detailed chi-squared breakdown for the QSTF model.
4.  It then calculates the total chi-squared for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model using its fixed, Planck-derived parameters.
5.  Finally, it calculates the difference in the total chi-squared values between the two models and translates this into a **statistical significance in sigma ($\sigma$)**, providing the final, conclusive result.
